# Biscuit_Tapper
This game requires Python and Pygame to function. Both can be downloaded from their respective websites.

A game where you tap on a biscuit to collect biscuits, which you then spend on upgrades that help you get more biscuits (Basically just Cookie Clicker) After some time, the screen will turn red and you will begin to lose biscuits and upgrades, along with having everything increase in price. Survive for as long as you can during this phase, and get a high score!

There are two upgrades. The first one increases the amount of biscuits you get every time you click the biscuit, and the second one increases the amount of biscuits you get per second. Both these amounts can be seen underneath the biscuit. The “boss fight” will cause you to lose an increasing number of biscuits per second (shown as biscuit loss), make less per second and per click, and make all upgrades more expensive. When your score reaches below 0, the game ends, and your final score, the total amount of biscuits you gained throughout the game, will be shown (spending biscuits does not affect your score. Spend your biscuits!).
