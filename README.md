# Biscuit_Tapper
This game requires Python and Pygame to function. Both can be downloaded from their respective websites.

It is a game where you tap on a biscuit to collect biscuits, which you can then spend to get upgrades that will help you get more biscuits. Basically just Cookie Clicker. Survive for as long as you can during the "boss fight", and get a high score!

There are two upgrades. The first one increases the amount of biscuits you get every time you click the biscuit, and the second one increases the amount of biscuits you get per second. Both these amounts can be seen underneath the biscuit. The “boss fight” will cause you to lose an increasing number of biscuits per second (shown as biscuit loss), make less per second and per click, and make all upgrades more expensive. When your score reaches below 0, the game ends, and your final score, the total amount of biscuits you gained, will be shown.
